# <Making-a-Website-more-semantic.>

## Description

- This project was created so that I can develop the skill of taking exisiting code and making it better and more semantic without changing the functionality of the website. This is important because it will give me an understanding of the way some software developers work and it gave me a taste of what software developers do day in and day out.
- This project allowed me to learn new html element tags such as the figure and aside elements. I also had to learn how to make links go to a specific part of a page. Lastly, making the website more semantic means I had to make it more accessible for all users. This means I had to learn about the alt attribute and incorporate it into the coding of the website.
